## üëã About Me
I am a Data-Intensive Intelligent Software Systems master's student, currently enrolled in the Erasmus Mundus double-degree program. With a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, I am passionate about solving complex problems through AI, machine learning, and data science. Over the years, I have developed expertise in Python, Java, and various machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. My experience includes working on AI-powered medical report generation systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and scalable MLOps workflows. I've also gained practical knowledge in cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, alongside strong database management skills in SQL and MongoDB. I thrive in international environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring innovative ideas to life. My passion for continuous learning drives me to explore new challenges and create impactful solutions in the tech industry.
